This is a set of Generators for Warhammer Fantasy Role Play 4e.

It creates characters of level 1-4 using the 4e rules, it can add extra careers to them and mutations.

For character details, i.e. personality, descriptions and to some degree backgrounds I've added a bunch of 'detail sets' - the data from these comes from all over the place, WFRP itself, Cairn 2e, the famous dragon game, and teh great WFRP fan resource that is Liber Fanatica.

The group generator will roll you up anything from a squad of Road Wardens to a gang of Mutants.

The Vessel generator will provide you with a boat to ply the Reik complete with cargo, captain and passengers.

The Inn generator will create an Inn with food, drink, prices, innkeep & family and the clientele.

Finally there is a much less useful Dream Generator which I made for my campaign.

One day I might try add a Village Generator.
